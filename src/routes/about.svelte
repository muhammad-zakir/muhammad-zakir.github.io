<h1>About this (kind of) site</h1>

<p>
	This is the 'about' page. There's not much here, yet.
</p>
<p>
	So, this is basically another 'personal site project' that I've planned to develop some 'mini-but-sometimes-useful'
	tools, mainly for my personal use. Whilst also providing a playground for myself to tinker around with fresh
	technology stacks that I'm keen to learn more about with.
</p>
<p>
	Oh, and also. The 'blog' sections aren't really posts that I actually write or something. They are just a bunch of
	'default posts' coming from the code template that I currently tinker around with and as I might still used it
	within the foreseeable future as a preference for my tinkering. So, I keep them around for a little while. I might
	ended up actually writing some kind of blog, if I'm not too darn lazy to do so :).
